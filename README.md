# EEG Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for my deep learning internship project focused on EEG data analysis. The project involves loading EEG data, conducting spectral analysis, implementing deep learning models for classification, and evaluating their performance.

## Folder Structure
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model training.
  - `eeg_analysis.ipynb`: Detailed analysis notebook covering data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts used for data processing, model training, and utility functions.
  - `populate_mongodb.py`: Script for populating MongoDB with EEG data.
  - `edf_parameters.py`: Script for extracting EDF file parameters.
  - Other scripts as needed for data manipulation and model training.
- **data/**: Placeholder folder for EEG datasets used in the project.
  - Ensure datasets are stored here or provide instructions on how to obtain them.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd eeg_analysis_project
